                    text: 'Listen to an audio version of Genesis 1:1-2:3 in the easiest-to-understand translation. <br/><br/>This is a story about how God created the world out of nothing. God is special among all gods, because he speaks creation into existence. God shows his authority over creation by naming the things he creates. This story is mostly about God himself. God’s creation is not as important as God. <br/>God’s people used this creation story to show that their God is the one true creator God. They wanted to show that he is not like the other gods—our God is all powerful and gives authority to all things himself. <br/>This story has some poetry in it because it is written in the same style as the creation stories of the cultures around them. Although it may sound like poetry sometimes, it is also a true story that happened long ago, but the writer did not see it happen. He learned about these things from his ancestors. <br/>Stop here and discuss with your translation team: Tell each other a story from your culture about the creation of the world. Do people believe that it is true? If so, how does the story begin? How can you tell the difference in your language between a true story and an untrue story? Pause this audio here.<br/><br/>The first words in Genesis say, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” The words “heavens and the earth,” when said together, refer to everything in the entire universe. Most Bible scholars believe that this means that nothing existed before God created the heavens and the earth. The word in the original language for “create” usually means to make something out of nothing. Only God can create something. <br/>When God made the earth, at first it was empty, like a desert or wilderness. Nothing lived on it. There were no plants or animals. It was like deep waters covered the earth. God’s Spirit or breath hovered over the deep waters. God himself was there. He was probably hovering or moving above the waters like a protection. God was about to begin creating the things on the earth. <br/>This story is clearly divided into an introduction, a section for each of the 6 days of creation, and then a section about the 7th day. Days 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 6 correspond with each other. <br/>On day 1 God spoke and light appeared. God separated light from darkness. This shows that God wants light to be in the daytime and darkness to be at night. God is making an orderly creation. <br/>On day 2 God creates the waters in the sky and the waters on the earth. God is making an orderly separation of the sky and the seas. <br/>On day 3 God is separating water from land. He is showing two places where his creation can live—some in the water and some on the land. God also creates the vegetation, or the plants, that live on the dry land. God creates two kinds of plants. Some plants have seeds in them, like grain. Some plants have fruit that have seeds in their fruit. Both of these kinds of plants have seeds to make it possible to produce new plants just like their parent plants. <br/>These first three days show us the places where God’s creation lives and the way God made time into days and nights. <br/>The 4th day corresponds to the 1st day, because now God creates the things that give off the light. God calls the things “lights,” and then he says that there is a larger light for the day and a smaller light for the night. God does not name these lights, probably because he wants to show that the lights themselves are not gods. These lights show us that time follows an order through days, months, and years. <br/>Stop here and discuss as a team: Tell a story from your culture about things that people in your culture worship besides the creator God. Pause this audio here.<br/>The 5th day corresponds to the 2nd day. Now God fills the two “waters,” the sky and the water on the earth with animals. He fills the sky with birds and the water with fish. Creatures in the water include both the large animals and the small ones. God blesses them and then gives them a command to fill the earth.<br/>The 6th day corresponds to the 3rd day. God creates two things on the 6th day in order to fill the dry land. He creates animals who have children just like themselves. He creates people who also reproduce other people just like themselves. The original language shows us that the 6th day is the most important day of creation. God gives us more detail on this day — he tells us that he created human beings on the 6th day. God says he creates humans in his image. People carry the image of God. That means that they are somehow like God physically and spiritually. They can think and they have a conscience, or a way to tell right from wrong. In the Old Testament, sometimes representatives of a king or queen were called an image. God is saying that people are representatives of him. God made it clear that he made both men and women in his image. God also blessed people in the same way as the animals and plants by telling them to multiply and fill the earth. But he gave them a special task of ruling over creation and taking care of it. God gave people and animals plants and fruit trees for food.<br/>Stop and discuss as a translation team: How will you talk about God creating people in his own image? Pause this audio here.<br/>At the end of each day, except for the second day, God says that every day is good, or beautiful.  But when God looked over everything he had made on the 6th day—including people—he said it was very good!  <br/>By the end of the 6th day God had completed his creation work—which included everything in the heavens and earth. He made holy, or set apart, the 7th day and blessed it. He rested, or he stopped creating his work. God did not rest because he was tired—this resting refers to him stopping work. <br/>Stop and discuss as a translation team: God made the 7th day “holy,” or set apart. Talk about things in your culture that are set apart for a special purpose. How do you talk about them?<br/>This is the end of the recording.',

He also creates all the plants.<br/><strong>In the fourth scene:</strong> God creates specific lights like the sun, moon, and stars on the fourth day.<br/><strong>In the fifth scene:</strong> God fills the sky and water with birds and fish on the fifth day.<br/><strong>In the sixth scene:</strong> God fills the earth with animals and the first man and woman on the sixth day. He finishes his creation work on the sixth day.<br/><strong>In the seventh scene:</strong> God stops working and makes the seventh day a special day set apart because it was the day he finished his work.<br/><br/>The characters in this passage are: <ul><li>God</li><li>Birds, fish, land animals</li><li>Man and woman</li></ul>As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage’s setting: It is important to remember that this story begins with a description of the empty and formless earth before God began to make order on the earth and fill it with living things. God’s Spirit or breath hovers over the waters, creating a sense of suspense that soon God will start working to create the world. <br/><br/>This story is a report of the things God created in the order that he created them. This report of God’s creation uses a lot of repetition. The author says each day’s creation in the same way. <br/>Stop here and discuss as a translation team: How do you report a list of things that someone does in the order that they do them? What kind of repetition or structure do you use to remember the list? Pause this audio here.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that on the first day God separates light from darkness. God saw that the light was good. Then he names day and night. Then it was evening and morning, the first day. <br/><br/>Then on the 2nd day God separates sky from water. God names the sky. Then it is evening and morning, the 2nd day. <br/><br/>Then on the 3rd day God separates water from dry land. God names the sea and the land. God says it is good. Then God creates vegetation—plants that have seeds and plants that have fruit—on the dry ground. God says it was good. Then it is evening and morning, the 3rd day.<br/><br/>These separations provide orderly space for people and animals to live. These first three days show us the places where God’s creation lives and the way God made time into days and nights. The next three days show God filling the sky, the water, and the land with his creation.<br/><br/>On the 4th day God creates the lights in the sky to mark special times of the year and to mark the days, months, and years. He describes the greater and lesser lights and explains their purpose. God saw that it was good. Then it is evening and morning, the 4th day.<br/><br/>On the 5th day God creates all kinds of creatures, big and small, in the water. God also creates all the kinds of birds that fly in the sky. God saw that it was good. Now God begins to bless parts of his creation. God blesses the creatures of the sea and the birds and he commands them to multiply and fill the earth. Then it is evening and morning, the 5th day.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that God gave many more details about his creation on the 6th day. He created livestock like cows and goats, creeping things that crawl close to the ground, and wild beasts or animals. He said that they were good. Then he made people in his own image. God blessed the people and commanded people to fill the earth with other people. God said the people had authority and responsibility over his creation to take care of it. God gave people everything they needed—every plant that has seeds. God gave animals every green plant to eat. Then God said it was all very good! Then it is evening and morning, the 6th day.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that the description of each day ends with a phrase that means the work of that day was ended—It was evening and morning, the 1st (or whichever) day. This means that when the morning came, that day was finished. <br/>Stop here and discuss as a team: How will you end the work of each day in your story?
